Let's face it: Basically every male born from 1980-present day learned about sex the ol' fashioned way: cheap porno movies they stole from their uncle's closet.

For most impressionable adolescents and teens they learn how to use what their mamma done gave them from movies like _Jurassic Wood_, _Edward Penishands _and _Gangbangs of New York. _

And that, my friends, is a lot of power. 

A power that can be wielded for good or evil. We at Hoary Gamer have always been staunchly anti-evil and pro-good, so we feel it is our duty, as citizens of these United States, to use our platform to try to do something good for the world. For once in our God damn lives, we want to do something good. 

So listen up Masters of Porn: We are looking to you, the true heroes, to set a good example for teenagers who watch porn daily (and totally not married dudes, lol!). 

Hear our call, Masters of Porn! Heed our pleas! 

Anyways, here are **five ways porn can change the world for the better:**

1. More interracial bangin'
2. More really nice and thoughtful fucking

**More guys jizzing on random objects**

Let's face it: When you're first learning to fuck, and just watching porno constantly, you sometimes just don't know where to jizz.

Your jizz might end up anywhere, for all you know. Towels, blankets, 18th century family heirlooms, the remote, a batch of fresh baked cookies â€” you just never know! 

And girls, don't act like you don't do it too! ;)

Porn should take the opportunity to provide more realism in the form of the actors and actresses jizzing on things like stereos, baseball cards, mantles and marble busts of former president Jimmy Carter.

**More random b-grade celebrity cameos**

Oh hey there, EMILIO FUCKING ESTEVEZ. 

How does that sound when you're watching porn 10 to 12 times a day, teenagers?! (And totally not married dudes, lol!)

More animals awkwardly watching
